    st.write("""
    **Bake My Day**, a popular bakery known for its delicious and creative pastries, is struggling with recipe management. Their recipes are currently stored on handwritten cards and scattered notebooks, making it difficult for bakers to find specific recipes quickly and consistently. This chaos often leads to errors in ingredient measurements and baking times, impacting the quality and consistency of their baked goods.
    """)
    
    st.write("""
    **Challenges:**
    - Handwritten recipes are time-consuming to locate and prone to damage or misplacement.
    - Variations in handwriting and lack of standardized units can lead to inaccurate measurements and inconsistencies in baking results.
    - New recipes developed by one baker are not readily accessible to others, hindering knowledge sharing and innovation.
    - Estimating ingredient needs based on handwritten recipes is difficult, leading to potential overstocking or understocking of ingredients.
    """)

    st.write("""
    **Proposed Solution:**
    - Using dictionaries and lists to provide a structured and searchable way to store and access recipes, eliminating reliance on handwritten cards.
    - Calculations can ensure consistent ingredient amounts, leading to more reliable baking results.
    - All bakers can access and share recipes within the program, fostering knowledge exchange and recipe innovation.
    - The system can calculate the total ingredient needs for a recipe batch, aiding in inventory planning and preventing stock shortages.
    """)

    st.subheader("Discussion Questions")
    st.write("""
    1. **What are some limitations of using simple data types for recipe management?**
        - Simple data types such as strings and basic lists can lack the necessary structure and flexibility needed for comprehensive recipe management.
        - They may not easily support complex queries or updates, and large amounts of data can become cumbersome to manage and prone to errors.
    
    2. **How could these limitations be addressed by incorporating libraries or more complex data structures?**
        - Incorporating libraries such as pandas can allow for more sophisticated data manipulation and querying capabilities.
        - Using more complex data structures like nested dictionaries or dataframes can provide better organization and accessibility for recipes, allowing for more efficient searches, updates, and calculations.
    
    3. **How can Bake My Day further leverage the system to automate other aspects of their operations?**
        - Bake My Day can integrate inventory management by linking ingredient usage with stock levels to automate reordering processes.
        - They can implement scheduling and task management for bakers, automating workflow and ensuring timely preparation of baked goods.
        - Additionally, they can use the system to analyze sales data and customer preferences, optimizing recipe offerings and improving customer satisfaction.

    st.write("A professor at our university envisioned creating a comprehensive Faculty Enhancement System (FES) within the university's Knowledge Pro (KP) system. With a solid understanding of Python programming, the professor embarked on a journey to develop this system to help both faculty and students efficiently manage academic information.")
    
    st.header("Project Overview")
    st.write("The project began by defining the core data structures and functions for the system. A FacultyMember class was created to represent each faculty member, with attributes such as name, faculty ID, courses, and performance metrics. Utilizing methods and constructors, the professor ensured that each faculty member object could be instantiated with the necessary details.")
    
    st.write("As the system grew, the professor recognized the importance of organizing faculty by courses for better navigation and management. Data structures like lists, sets, and dictionaries were employed to implement different types of course-related information and performance metrics. To maintain security and encapsulation, the professor used access specifiers to control the visibility and interaction of class members.")
    
    st.write("As the system expanded further, the professor faced the challenge of calculating performance metrics and ratings efficiently. Functions were used to perform these calculations. For optimization and stability, sets were used to ensure the uniqueness of course assignments and tuples to store immutable data like faculty IDs.")
    
    st.write("The professor also envisioned a way to handle diverse faculty types and academic structures. With determination and mastery of Python programming, the vision was successfully brought to life. The Faculty Enhancement System became a beacon of organization and efficiency for faculty and students at the university, showcasing the power and elegance of Python programming.")
