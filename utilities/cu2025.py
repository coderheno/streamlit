    st.write("""
    **1. Pre-Production**:
    - This is the planning phase of the production process. It includes the development of the script, storyboarding, and preparing all the necessary elements for shooting.
    - **Tools**: 
        - **Scriptwriting Software** like **Celtx** or **Final Draft** to help structure your script.
        - **Storyboarding Tools** like **Storyboard That** or **Canva** to visualize your scenes.
        - **Location Scouting** using tools like **Shot Lister**.

    **2. Production**:
    - The shooting phase where the video is filmed.
    - **Tools**: 
        - **Teleprompter Apps** like **PromptSmart** or **Teleprompter Pro** help you read your script while looking directly into the camera, making your delivery smoother and more natural.
        - **Camera Equipment**: A DSLR or Mirrorless Camera is ideal for high-quality video. For a more budget-friendly option, **smartphones** with high-resolution cameras work too.
        - **Lighting Tools**: Softbox lighting or ring lights, such as **Neewer** or **Elgato Key Light**, to ensure your face is well-lit and visually appealing.

    **3. Post-Production**:
    - The editing phase where all the footage is put together, refined, and finalized.
    - **Tools**:
        - **Editing Software**: **Adobe Premiere Pro**, **Final Cut Pro**, or **DaVinci Resolve** for professional-level editing. For beginners, **Camedica** or **Filmora** can be good alternatives.
        - **Color Grading Tools**: Use tools like **FilmConvert** or **DaVinci Resolve** to adjust the colors and make the video look more polished.
        - **Audio Editing**: Use **Audacity** (free) or **Adobe Audition** for noise reduction, equalization, and mastering the audio.
        - **Text and Animation**: **After Effects** or **Camtasia** can be used for adding titles, transitions, and animations to enhance the video.

    **4. Feedback & Review**:
    - After post-production, it's important to review your video, get feedback from peers or mentors, and make necessary revisions.
    - Ask for feedback on aspects like the flow of information, pacing, and engagement. Ensure the call to action is clear and impactful.

    A **teleprompter** can make a significant difference in delivering your script smoothly and naturally. Here are some prompter apps you can use:
    - **PromptSmart Pro**: This is a highly recommended teleprompter app that automatically follows your speech, ensuring you don‚Äôt get stuck reading.
    - **Teleprompter Pro**: Another great app that offers a simple interface and works well for both iOS and Android devices. It also lets you control the speed of the script and add cues.
    - **Parrot Teleprompter**: A low-cost solution for small setups, with both mobile and professional use options.
    - **OnCue**: Offers a full teleprompter system that you can use to project your script onto a screen while you record.

    **Tips for Using a Teleprompter**:
    - **Practice**: Familiarize yourself with the script before recording. Even though the teleprompter follows your speech, you should feel comfortable and natural while delivering your lines.
    - **Speed**: Adjust the scrolling speed of the teleprompter to match your speaking pace. If you speak slowly, ensure the text doesn‚Äôt move too quickly.
    - **Eye Contact**: Position the teleprompter screen so it‚Äôs directly in front of the camera, ensuring that you maintain eye contact with the audience. This makes you appear more engaging and sincere.

    By using a teleprompter, you'll look more confident and professional, making it easier to deliver a smooth and impactful video.

    st.write("""
    A strong, engaging script is key to creating a captivating promo video for your online course. Here are some tips to help you write an effective and impactful promo script:
    """)

    st.header("üí° Script Preparation Tips")
    st.write("""
    1. **Start Strong**:
       - **Tip**: Begin your script with a **hook** to capture attention immediately. For example, rather than using generic greetings like "Good morning" or "Hello", start with something more engaging, such as "Ready to turbocharge your web app development skills?" This piques interest right away and sets the tone for your course.
    
    2. **Focus on Benefits, Not Features**:
       - **Tip**: Instead of just listing features, highlight the **benefits** the learner will gain. For instance, instead of saying, ‚ÄúYou will learn how to use Streamlit,‚Äù try something like, ‚ÄúBy the end of this course, you‚Äôll be able to build stunning web apps in minutes.‚Äù

    3. **Keep It Conversational**:
       - **Tip**: Use a **friendly and conversational tone**. Imagine you are talking to a friend, not reading from a textbook. Avoid jargon unless it‚Äôs essential, and explain terms if necessary. For example, your script starts with ‚ÄúIn just 15 hours, this course will take you from novice to ninja,‚Äù which is clear and engaging, not overly technical.
    
    4. **Structure Your Script**:
       - **Tip**: Structure your script so it flows smoothly. Break down the content into **three sections**:
         - **Introduction**: Present the value of the course.
         - **Middle**: Explain how the course works and what the learner will gain.
         - **Conclusion**: End with a strong call to action, such as "Enroll now and become a web app development ninja!"

    5. **Engage with Visuals**:
       - **Tip**: Align the visuals with the script. For example, in your script, you mention "Random photo of coding and demonstrating code" ‚Äî visuals should be complementary and not overly busy. Make sure they enhance the story rather than distract from it.

    6. **Use a Call to Action (CTA)**:
       - **Tip**: Always include a strong call to action at the end of your script. Phrases like ‚ÄúSo, are you ready to join the Streamlit revolution?‚Äù or ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs embark on this exhilarating journey together‚Äù create excitement and encourage action. Your CTA should be clear, concise, and motivating.

    7. **Timing and Pacing**:
       - **Tip**: Keep an eye on your script‚Äôs length. A promo video should be brief but impactful (1 minute). Adjust the pacing to ensure you're not rushing through key points. If you're exceeding 1 minute, consider trimming down or splitting information into multiple sections.

    8. **Don‚Äôt Overcomplicate**:
       - **Tip**: Simplicity is key. Avoid complicated language or long-winded sentences. For example, instead of saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll explore and demonstrate how to use dynamic data sources and integrate interactive elements seamlessly,‚Äù break it down into something clearer, like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll easily learn to bring your data to life with interactive elements.‚Äù
    """)

    st.header("üìã Do's and Don'ts for Scriptwriting")
    st.write("""
    **Do‚Äôs**:
    - **Do** engage your audience immediately with an exciting opening.
    - **Do** keep your sentences short and easy to follow.
    - **Do** maintain an active voice: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll learn‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúYou will be taught.‚Äù
    - **Do** include a strong closing statement to motivate learners to take action.

    **Don‚Äôts**:
    - **Don‚Äôt** start with generic greetings like ‚ÄúGood morning‚Äù or ‚ÄúHello, everyone.‚Äù
    - **Don‚Äôt** overload the script with technical jargon without explanations.
    - **Don‚Äôt** make it too long‚Äîaim for brevity and clarity.
    - **Don‚Äôt** leave the audience hanging‚Äîalways end with a call to action!
