st.write("""
**Human Languages** are systems of communication used by humans. They can be spoken, written, or signed and are used to convey thoughts, ideas, emotions, and information.

Key characteristics of human languages include:
- Grammar, syntax, and vocabulary
- They allow for natural communication between humans
- Examples include: English, Hindi, Tamil, etc.

**Programming Languages**, on the other hand, are formal languages used to communicate with computers. These languages consist of instructions designed to produce various outputs and perform specific tasks.

Key characteristics of programming languages include:
- Strict syntax and rules
- Used for computational tasks
- Examples include: Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript

**Python** is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility, making it one of the most popular languages for beginners and professionals alike.

### Key Features of Python:
- Easy-to-understand syntax that is similar to plain English
- Extensive standard library and ecosystem of third-party libraries
- Wide usage in areas such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and genomics

Python's flexibility and ease of use have made it an industry standard for scientific research and data analysis, particularly in the field of genomics.
